# Yo! CorDapp

**NOTE:** This CorDapp targets Corda M11.

Send Yo's! to all your friends running Corda nodes!

## Pre-Requisites

You will need the following installed on your machine before you can start:

* Latest [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
  installed and available on your path.
* Latest version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* git

## Getting Set Up

To get started, clone this repository with:

     git clone https://github.com/roger3cev/yo-cordapp.git

And change directories to the newly cloned repo:

     cd yo-cordapp

## Building the Yo! CorDapp:

**Unix:** 

     ./gradlew deployNodes

**Windows:**

     gradlew.bat deployNodes

## Running the Nodes:

Once the build finishes, change directories to the folder where the newly
built nodes are located:

**Kotlin:**

     cd build/nodes

**Java:**

     cd build/nodes

The Gradle build script will have created a folder for each node. You'll
see three folders, one for each node and a `runnodes` script. You can
run the nodes with:

**Unix:**

     ./runnodes

**Windows:**

    runnodes.bat

You should now have three Corda nodes running on your machine serving
the Yo! CorDapp.

Six windows will open in the terminal, two for each one with one being the node
shell and the other being the web server.

## Interacting with the CorDapp via HTTP

The Yo! CorDapp defines a couple of HTTP API end-points.

The nodes can be found using the following port numbers output in the web server
terminal window or in the `build.gradle` file.

     NodeA: localhost:10007
     NodeB: localhost:10010

Sending a Yo:

    http://localhost:10007/api/yo/yo?target=NodeB (From NodeA to NodeB)

Showing all your Yo's:

     http://localhost:10010/api/yo/yos (NodeB)
     
Finding out who you are:

    http://localhost:10010/api/yo/me (NodeB)

Finding out who you can send Yo's! to:

    http://localhost:10010/api/yo/peers (NodeA, NodeB)

## Using the RPC Client

Use the gradle command:

     ./gradlew runYoRPCNodeA
     
or 
     
     ./gradlew runYoRPCNodeB (for NodeB)

When running it should enumerate all previously received Yo's! as well as show any new Yo's! 
received when they are sent to you.

## Using the node shell

The node shell is a great way to test your CorDapps without having to create a user interface. 

When the nodes are up and running, use the following command to send a Yo! to another node:

    flow start YoFlow target: [NODE_NAME]
    
Where `NODE_NAME` is NodeA or NodeB. The space after the `:` is required. Note you can't sent a Yo! to yourself because that's not cool.

To see all your Yo's! use:

    run vaultAndUpdates
