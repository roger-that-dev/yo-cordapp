# Yo! CorDapp

**NOTE:** This CorDapp targets Corda v1.0.

Send Yo's! to all your friends running Corda nodes!

## Pre-Requisites

You will need the following installed on your machine before you can start:

* Latest [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
  installed and available on your path.
* Latest version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* git

## Getting Set Up

To get started, clone this repository with:

     git clone https://github.com/roger3cev/yo-cordapp.git

And change directories to the newly cloned repo:

     cd yo-cordapp

## Building the Yo! CorDapp:

**Unix:** 

     ./gradlew clean deployNodes

**Windows:**

     gradlew.bat clean deployNodes

## Running the Nodes:

Once the build finishes, change directories to the folder where the newly
built nodes are located:

**Kotlin:**

     cd build/nodes

**Java:**

     cd build/nodes

The Gradle build script will have created a folder for each node. You'll
see three folders, one for each node and a `runnodes` script. You can
run the nodes with:

**Unix:**

     ./runnodes

**Windows:**

    runnodes.bat

You should now have three Corda nodes running on your machine serving
the Yo! CorDapp.

Five windows will open in the terminal. One for each node's node shell, plus webservers for Party A and Party B.

## Interacting with the CorDapp via HTTP

The Yo! CorDapp defines a couple of HTTP API end-points.

The nodes can be found using the following port numbers output in the web server
terminal window or in the `build.gradle` file.

     NodeA: localhost:10007
     NodeB: localhost:10010

Sending a Yo! from Party A to Party B (we use Party B's X500 name):

    http://localhost:10007/api/yo/yo?target=O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US

Showing all of Party B's Yo's!:

     http://localhost:10010/api/yo/yos
     
Finding out who Party B is:

    http://localhost:10010/api/yo/me

Finding out who Party B can send Yo's! to:

    http://localhost:10010/api/yo/peers

## Using the RPC Client

Use the gradle command (for Party A):

     ./gradlew runYoRPCNodeA
     
or (for Party B):
     
     ./gradlew runYoRPCNodeB

When running it should enumerate all previously received Yo's! as well as show any new Yo's! 
received when they are sent to you.

## Using the node shell

The node shell is a great way to test your CorDapps without having to create a user interface. 

When the nodes are up and running, use the following command to send a Yo! to another node:

    flow start YoFlow target: [NODE_NAME]
    
Where `NODE_NAME` is 'PartyA' or 'PartyB'. The space after the `:` is required. You are not required to use the full 
X500 name in the node shell. Note you can't sent a Yo! to yourself because that's not cool!

To see all the Yo's! in your vault:

    run vaultQuery contractStateType: net.corda.yo.YoState
